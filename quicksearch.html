If the request body is large, sending it to a server when a request has already been rejected based upon inappropriate headers is inefficient. To have a server check if the request could be accepted based on the request's headers alone, a client must send Expect: 100-continue as a header in its initial request and check if a 100 Continue status code is received in response before continuing (or receive 417 Expectation Failed and not continue).[6] Type: Number COOKIE :String An HTTP cookie previously sent by the server with Set-Cookie (below).

This method MAY be overridden by human intervention (or other means) on the origin server. The client cannot be guaranteed that the operation has been carried out, even if the status code returned from the origin server indicates that the action has been completed successfully. However, the server SHOULD NOT indicate success unless, at the time the response is given, it intends to delete the resource or move it to an inaccessible location. A successful response SHOULD be 200 (OK) if the response includes an entity describing the status, 202 (Accepted) if the action has not yet been enacted, or 204 (No Content) if the action has been enacted but the response does not include an entity. If the request passes through a cache and the Request-URI identifies one or more currently cached entities, those entries SHOULD be treated as stale. Responses to this method are not cacheable.

Unlike a 401 Unauthorized response, authenticating will make no difference.[39] Type: Number FOUND :Number Found This is an example of industry practice contradicting the standard. The HTTP/1.0 specification (RFC 1945) required the client to perform a temporary redirect (the original describing phrase was &quot;Moved Temporarily&quot;),[24] but popular browsers implemented 302 with the functionality of a 303 See Other. Therefore, HTTP/1.1 added status codes 303 and 307 to distinguish between the two behaviours.[25] However, some Web applications and frameworks use the 302 status code as if it were the 303.[26] Type: Number fpx FlashPix FROM :String The email address of the user making the request.

If the Request-URI refers to a data-producing process, it is the produced data which shall be returned as the entity in the response and not the source text of the process, unless that text happens to be the output of the process. The semantics of the GET method change to a &quot;conditional GET&quot; if the request message includes an If-Modified-Since, If-Unmodified-Since, If-Match, If-None-Match, or If-Range header field. A conditional GET method requests that the entity be transferred only under the circumstances described by the conditional header field(s). The conditional GET method is intended to reduce unnecessary network usage by allowing cached entities to be refreshed without requiring multiple requests or transferring data already held by the client. The semantics of the GET method change to a &quot;partial GET&quot; if the request message includes a Range header field. A partial GET requests that only part of the entity be transferred, as described in section 14.35. The partial GET method is intended to reduce unnecessary network usage by allowing partially-retrieved entities to be completed without transferring data already held by the client. The response to a GET request is cacheable if and only if it meets the requirements for HTTP caching described in section 13. See section 15.1.3 for security considerations when used for forms.

This should be used when a resource has been intentionally removed and the resource should be purged. Upon receiving a 410 status code, the client should not request the resource again in the future. Clients such as search engines should remove the resource from their indices.[45] Most use cases do not require clients and search engines to purge the resource, and a &quot;404 Not Found&quot; may be used instead.

The metainformation contained in the HTTP headers in response to a HEAD request SHOULD be identical to the information sent in response to a GET request. This method can be used for obtaining metainformation about the entity implied by the request without transferring the entity-body itself. This method is often used for testing hypertext links for validity, accessibility, and recent modification. The response to a HEAD request MAY be cacheable in the sense that the information contained in the response MAY be used to update a previously cached entity from that resource. If the new field values indicate that the cached entity differs from the current entity (as would be indicated by a change in Content-Length, Content-MD5, ETag or Last-Modified), then the cache MUST treat the cache entry as stale.

Subsequent requests by the client are permissible.[40] Type: Number NOT_IMPLEMENTED :Number Not Implemented The server either does not recognize the request method, or it lacks the ability to fulfill the request. Usually this implies future availability (e.g., a new feature of a web-service API).[79] Type: Number NOT_MODIFIED :Number Not Modified (RFC 7232) Indicates that the resource has not been modified since the version specified by the request headers If-Modified-Since or If-None-Match. This means that there is no need to retransmit the resource, since the client still has a previously-downloaded copy.[28] Type: Number npx FlashPix nsf Lotus Notes oa2 Fujitsu Oasys oa3 Fujitsu Oasys oas Fujitsu Oasys obd Microsoft Office Binder oda Office Document Architecture odb OpenDocument Database odc OpenDocument Chart odf OpenDocument Formula odft OpenDocument Formula Template odg OpenDocument Graphics odi OpenDocument Image odm OpenDocument Text Master odp OpenDocument Presentation ods OpenDocument Spreadsheet odt OpenDocument Text oga Ogg Audio ogv Ogg Video ogx Ogg OK :Number OK Standard response for successful HTTP requests. The actual response will depend on the request method used. In a GET request, the response will contain an entity corresponding to the requested resource. In a POST request, the response will contain an entity describing or containing the result of the action.[10] Type: Number onetoc Microsoft OneNote opf Open eBook Publication Structure OPTIONS :String The OPTIONS method represents a request for information about the communication options available on the request/response chain identified by the Request-URI. This method allows the client to determine the options and/or requirements associated with a resource, or the capabilities of a server, without implying a resource action or initiating a resource retrieval. Responses to this method are not cacheable. If the OPTIONS request includes an entity-body (as indicated by the presence of Content-Length or Transfer-Encoding), then the media type MUST be indicated by a Content-Type field. Although this specification does not define any use for such a body, future extensions to HTTP might use the OPTIONS body to make more detailed queries on the server. A server that does not support such an extension MAY discard the request body. If the Request-URI is an asterisk (&quot;*&quot;), the OPTIONS request is intended to apply to the server in general rather than to a specific resource. Since a server's communication options typically depend on the resource, the &quot;*&quot; request is only useful as a &quot;ping&quot; or &quot;no-op&quot; type of method, it does nothing beyond allowing the client to test the capabilities of the server. For example, this can be used to test a proxy for HTTP/1.1 compliance (or lack thereof). If the Request-URI is not an asterisk, the OPTIONS request applies only to the options that are available when communicating with that resource. A 200 response SHOULD include any header fields that indicate optional features implemented by the server and applicable to that resource (e.g., Allow), possibly including extensions not defined by this specification. The response body, if any, SHOULD also include information about the communication options. The format for such a body is not defined by this specification, but might be defined by future extensions to HTTP. Content negotiation MAY be used to select the appropriate response format. If no response body is included, the response MUST include a Content-Length field with a field-value of &quot;0&quot;. The Max-Forwards request-header field MAY be used to target a specific proxy in the request chain. When a proxy receives an OPTIONS request on an absoluteURI for which request forwarding is permitted, the proxy MUST check for a Max-Forwards field. If the Max-Forwards field-value is zero (&quot;0&quot;), the proxy MUST NOT forward the message, instead, the proxy SHOULD respond with its own communication options. If the Max-Forwards field-value is an integer greater than zero, the proxy MUST decrement the field-value when it forwards the request. If no Max-Forwards field is present in the request, then the forwarded request MUST NOT include a Max-Forwards field.

POST is designed to allow a uniform method to cover the following functions: Annotation of existing resources, Posting a message to a bulletin board, newsgroup, mailing list, or similar group of articles, Providing a block of data, such as the result of submitting a form, to a data-handling process, Extending a database through an append operation. The actual function performed by the POST method is determined by the server and is usually dependent on the Request-URI. The posted entity is subordinate to that URI in the same way that a file is subordinate to a directory containing it, a news article is subordinate to a newsgroup to which it is posted, or a record is subordinate to a database. The action performed by the POST method might not result in a resource that can be identified by a URI. In this case, either 200 (OK) or 204 (No Content) is the appropriate response status, depending on whether or not the response includes an entity that describes the result. If a resource has been created on the origin server, the response SHOULD be 201 (Created) and contain an entity which describes the status of the request and refers to the new resource, and a Location header (see section 14.30). Responses to this method are not cacheable, unless the response includes appropriate Cache-Control or Expires header fields. However, the 303 (See Other) response can be used to direct the user agent to retrieve a cacheable resource. POST requests MUST obey the message transmission requirements set out in section 8.2. See section 15.1.3 for security considerations.

Intended to prevent &quot;the 'lost update' problem, where a client GETs a resource's state, modifies it, and PUTs it back to the server, when meanwhile a third party has modified the state on the server, leading to a conflict.&quot;[61] Type: Number prf PICSRules PROCESSING :Number Processing (WebDAV, RFC 2518) As a WebDAV request may contain many sub-requests involving file operations, it may take a long time to complete the request. This code indicates that the server has received and is processing the request, but no response is available yet.[8] This prevents the client from timing out and assuming the request was lost.

If the Request-URI refers to an already existing resource, the enclosed entity SHOULD be considered as a modified version of the one residing on the origin server. If the Request-URI does not point to an existing resource, and that URI is capable of being defined as a new resource by the requesting user agent, the origin server can create the resource with that URI. If a new resource is created, the origin server MUST inform the user agent via the 201 (Created) response. If an existing resource is modified, either the 200 (OK) or 204 (No Content) response codes SHOULD be sent to indicate successful completion of the request. If the resource could not be created or modified with the Request-URI, an appropriate error response SHOULD be given that reflects the nature of the problem. The recipient of the entity MUST \\NOT ignore any Content-* (e.g. Content-Range) headers that it does not understand or implement and MUST return a 501 (Not Implemented) response in such cases. If the request passes through a cache and the Request-URI identifies one or more currently cached entities, those entries SHOULD be treated as stale. Responses to this method are not cacheable. The fundamental difference between the POST and PUT requests is reflected in the different meaning of the Request-URI. The URI in a POST request identifies the resource that will handle the enclosed entity. That resource might be a data-accepting process, a gateway to some other protocol, or a separate entity that accepts annotations. In contrast, the URI in a PUT request identifies the entity enclosed with the request -- the user agent knows what URI is intended and the server MUST NOT attempt to apply the request to some other resource. If the server desires that the request be applied to a different URI, it MUST send a 301 (Moved Permanently) response, the user agent MAY then make its own decision regarding whether or not to redirect the request. A single resource MAY be identified by many different URIs. For example, an article might have a URI for identifying &quot;the current version&quot; which is separate from the URI identifying each particular version. In this case, a PUT request on a general URI might result in several other URIs being defined by the origin server. HTTP/1.1 does not define how a PUT method affects the state of an origin server. PUT requests MUST obey the message transmission requirements set out in section 8.2. Unless otherwise specified for a particular entity-header, the entity-headers in the PUT request SHOULD be applied to the resource created or modified by the PUT.

The final recipient of the request SHOULD reflect the message received back to the client as the entity-body of a 200 (OK) response. The final recipient is either the origin server or the first proxy or gateway to receive a Max-Forwards value of zero (0) in the request (see section 14.31). A TRACE request MUST NOT include an entity. TRACE allows the client to see what is being received at the other end of the request chain and use that data for testing or diagnostic information. The value of the Via header field (section 14.45) is of particular interest, since it acts as a trace of the request chain. Use of the Max-Forwards header field allows the client to limit the length of the request chain, which is useful for testing a chain of proxies forwarding messages in an infinite loop. If the request is valid, the response SHOULD contain the entire request message in the entity-body, with a Content-Type of &quot;message/http&quot;. Responses to this method MUST NOT be cached.

WWW-Authenticate: Basic Permanent x3d 3D Crossword Plugin X_ATT_DEVICEID :String Allows easier parsing of the MakeModel/Firmware that is usually found in the User-Agent String of AT&amp;T Devices. Examples: X-Att-Deviceid: GT-P7320/P7320XXLPG Type: String X_CONTENT_DURATION Provide the duration of the audio or video in seconds, only supported by Gecko browsers X-Content-Duration: 42.666 X_CONTENT_TYPE_OPTIONS The only defined value, &quot;nosniff&quot;, prevents Internet Explorer from MIME-sniffing a response away from the declared content-type. This also applies to Google Chrome, when downloading extensions. X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff X_CSRF_TOKEN Used to prevent cross-site request forgery. Alternative header names are: X-CSRFToken and X-XSRF-TOKEN X-Csrf-Token: i8XNjC4b8KVok4uw5RftR38Wgp2BFwql X_FORWARDED_FOR :String A de facto standard for identifying the originating IP address of a client connecting to a web server through an HTTP proxy or load balancer. Examples: X-Forwarded-For: client1, proxy1, proxy2 X-Forwarded-For: 129.78.138.66, 129.78.64.103 Type: String X_FORWARDED_HOST :String A de facto standard for identifying the original host requested by the client in the Host HTTP request header, since the host name and/or port of the reverse proxy (load balancer) may differ from the origin server handling the request. Examples: X-Forwarded-Host: en.wikipedia.org:80 X-Forwarded-Host: en.wikipedia.org Type: String X_FORWARDED_PROTO :String A de facto standard for identifying the originating protocol of an HTTP request, since a reverse proxy (load balancer) may communicate with a web server using HTTP even if the request to the reverse proxy is HTTPS. An alternative form of the header (X-ProxyUser-Ip) is used by Google clients talking to Google servers. Examples: X-Forwarded-Proto: https Type: String X_FRAME_OPTIONS Clickjacking protection: deny - no rendering within a frame, sameorigin - no rendering if origin mismatch, allow-from - allow from specified location, allowall - non-standard, allow from any location X-Frame-Options: deny Obsolete X_HTTP_METHOD_OVERRIDE :String Requests a web application override the method specified in the request (typically POST) with the method given in the header field (typically PUT or DELETE). Can be used when a user agent or firewall prevents PUT or DELETE methods from being sent directly (note that this either a bug in the software component, which ought to be fixed, or an intentional configuration, in which case bypassing it may be the wrong thing to do). Examples: X-HTTP-Method-Override: DELETE Type: String X_POWERED_BY specifies the technology (e.g. ASP.NET, PHP, JBoss) supporting the web application (version details are often in X-Runtime, X-Version, or X-AspNet-Version) X-Powered-By: PHP/5.4.0 X_REQUESTED_WITH :String mainly used to identify Ajax requests. Most JavaScript frameworks send this field with value of XMLHttpRequest. Examples: X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest Type: String X_UA_COMPATIBLE Recommends the preferred rendering engine (often a backward-compatibility mode) to use to display the content. Also used to activate Chrome Frame in Internet Explorer. X-UA-Compatible: IE=EmulateIE7 X-UA-Compatible: IE=edge X-UA-Compatible: Chrome=1 X_UIDH Server-side deep packet insertion of a unique ID identifying customers of Verizon Wireless, also known as &quot;perma-cookie&quot; or &quot;supercookie&quot; X-UIDH: ...
